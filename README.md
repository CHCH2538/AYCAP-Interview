# AYCAP-Interview : Weather App

- API : One Call API 1.0 (OpenWeather)
- Language : Swift
- Framework : SwiftUI (Due to time constraint)
- Package Manager : Xcode
- Dependency Used : SDWebImageSwiftUI

# Requirement Check

Page 1
- ✅ Text field for enter city name 
- ✅ Two label for display temperature and humidity (with extra aesthetic label)
- ✅ Image for display current weather (Via SDWebImageSwiftUI)
- ✅ Button for convert temperature in Celcius and Fahrenheit
- ✅ Right Navigation Bar for navigate to page 2

Page 2
- ✅ TableView for display 5 days forecast (By city name at page 1)
    - Not exactly TableView but very similar
    - Displayed exactly 5 days (can be edit to 7 days by deleting the .prefix(5) in DailyWeatherView.swift)

# Additional Info

I've declared (I think) all of the available variable in OneCall API in case the app needed an upgrade or expansion. Everything is ready to go with minimum to none adjustment to Models and Network stuff.

Thank you for the opportunity

again :)
